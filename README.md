# generalized-hasse-invariants

This simple class allows you to perform some explicit computations with GZipFlags and automorphic line bundles defined over them. It uses results from the article:

Goldring, Wushi ; Koskivirta, Jean-Stefan ;
Strata Hasse invariants, Hecke algebras and Galois representations.
Invent. Math. 217 (2019), no. 3, 887â€“984.
